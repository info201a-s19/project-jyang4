     presence on the internet can be vital to the success of a business. Yelp
     is a social platform that boasts 178 million monthly users. It provides
     businesses with a way to connect with their customers as well as for 
     potential customers to look and gather more information into businesses. 
     However, Yelp is a platform that has extensive data that can be 
     overwhleming. Our project takes a look at how businesses can use Yelp 
     data to become more competitive in their region against other businesses. 
     This problem requires us to take a look at what other businesses are
     around the area, the average star rating, and the average price range.

     will be creating interactive graphs and visualizations that would benefit
     new and current business owners.Since the Yelp Data Set is particularly large and
     spans across the continental United States, we thought it would 
     benefical to focus on a small area to show the biggest impact. For
     this project, we decided to focus in the region of Las Vegas, Nevada."),

        Vegas and Henderson, demonstrating that most businesses appeal to

        227 companies under $10, and 234 companies between $11-30, showing
        how most businesses appeal towards the lower middle class status.
