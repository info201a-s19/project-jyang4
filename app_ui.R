        North Las Vegas, and Henderson. Business owners seeking to start a
        business in Nevada can select different cities and see the most
        common type of price ranges businesses fall into. The bar chart reveals
        that Las Vegas has a bigger proportion of businesses above the $31
        range seen from the greater height of the bin compared to North Las
        Vegas and Henderson, demonstrating that most businesses appeal to
        customers toward the upper middle class status. North Las Vegas has
        227 companies under $10, and 234 companies between $11-30, showing
        how most businesses appeal towards the lower middle class status.
        Meanwhile, the bar chart reveals that most companies are in the
        $11-30 in Henderson, revealing how the general area is mostly filled
        with companies targeting the middle class consumers."
