    depending on the rating of the restaurant. While there isn't much of a
    connection for lower ratings, with 1-star restaurants having an R-squared
    as low as 0.02, the correlation is still somewhat consistent with R-squared
    values of 0.6 or higher. It's clear that the trend is positive in all cases,
    with more check-ins correlating to more reviews, but the magnitude of these
    trends vary according to the ratings. More average ratings, tending
    towards the ranges of 2-4 stars, have a typically higher coefficient in the
    correlation whereas the outer ratings have less of an effect. Thus, unless
    a restaurant has either unanimously awful or amazing ratings, it should try
    to invest heavily into its marketing, specifically word-of-mouth advertising
    through Yelp, in order to
    increase its amount of visitors in order to attain more reviews and gain
    traction on Yelp and in the reviewing sphere in general. However, once a

    chart reveals that most companies are in the $11-30 in Henderson, revealing
    how the general area is mostly filled with companies targeting the

    ranges, businesses that sell more luxurious items should open in Las Vegas

    products with a price range affordable to the average working class should
